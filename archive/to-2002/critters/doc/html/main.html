<a NAME="BRIEF"></a><b><font color="#3366FF">Project Brief</font></b></h1>

<p><br><font color="#FFFF80">Our project brief was to create a software
simulation in time and space of a simple ecosystem and to display the results
of this simulation graphically. The simulation space is divided into squares
that may contain food and be occupied by animals we call 'critters'. Except
during conflict resolution, no more than one critter may occupy each square.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">The project brief suggested that there were two
species of critter - herbivores and carnivores. Herbivores eat food that
they find growing in squares; carnivores eat other critters. The brief
also suggested that critters go forth and multiply.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>
<a NAME="REASONS"></a><b><font color="#3366FF">Reasons for choosing this
Project</font></b></h1>
<font color="#FFFF80">The overall project was composed of several sub-tasks
that could be easily separated out and allocated to individual members
of the group. The basic project brief left several areas for interpretation
and extension:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Two fixed species were defined with only one inherited
characteristic:</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Herbivore / Carnivore species type</font></li>
</ul>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Only two types of terrain were defined:</font></li>

<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Normal</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Impassable</font></li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h1>
<a NAME="EXTENSIONS"></a><font color="#3366FF">Extensions to basic project
outline</font></h1>
<font color="#FFFF80">As our first extension, we defined several terrain
types:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Plains</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Forest</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Water</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Impassable</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF80">To gain any insight into the effects of defining
several terrain types, it was clear that the different terrain types needed
to be 'clumped' together on the map. An automatic map generator was written
to create realistic maps. With this tool the user can specify the width
and height of the map, the ratio of the four terrain types in the map and
the file to which the map data must be written.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">We extended the idea of multiple terrain types
and gave the critters several characteristics that give them an advantage
in a particular terrain type. These characteristics included eyesight,
legs, fins (for water) and wings (for crossing impassable terrain). We
then faced two choices when combining the idea of critter characteristics
with breeding:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Create several species with fixed characteristics
inherited by each succeeding generation</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Create a few species with predefined initial characteristics
that can change between generations</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF80">We chose to implement inherited, modifiable characteristics.
There were three obvious ways to do this:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Asexual breeding (spawning with random mutations)</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">2 partner breeding (same sex)</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">2 partner breeding (different sexes)</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF80">We chose to use two-partner, same sex breeding, because
we were unsure how often two critters of the right age and different sexes
would meet. Using just one sex eliminated one of these uncertainties, while
providing a larger 'gene pool' of potential characteristics than asexual
spawning with random mutations.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">Implementing inherited, modifiable characteristics
changed the focus of the project somewhat. Instead of simulating a simple
ecosystem with a few competing, pre-defined species the project was now
an ideal vehicle to demonstrate the theory of evolution. As species evolved,
their distribution throughout the map</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">Displaying the results of the simulation to the
user can be implemented graphically, by drawing the map on the screen with
information about the terrain and the individual critters occupying each
square. Updating the map after each simulation cycle would show the user
what was happening to the critters and the terrain. With sufficiently detailed
glyphs, a large amount of information can be quickly communicated to the
user about each critter -size, energy and characteristics - and each map
square - food levels, terrain type, altitude. However, the user might also
wish to see overall trends in the critter population of energy levels,
age and particular critter characteristics.</font>
<ul>

<li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~pjf98/stats.html">Example statistics
window</a></li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>
<font color="#FFFF80">Two methods of displaying these statistics were defined
- as line graphs and histograms. Both types of graph would be updated after
each simulation cycle, but the line graph would show the selected values
(represented as height over time) by shifting previous values left, and
adding new values on the right. Each cycle's portion of the graph would
be only one or two pixels wide, allowing information generated over a long
time period to be easily communicated to the user who infrequently looks
at the statistics windows.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF80">A histogram gives more detailed information,
particularly with regard to the distribution of values over a given range,
but cannot show long term trends.</font>
<br><font color="#FFFF80">Implementing the two types of graph is clearly
desirable since they complement each other well and fulfil different needs;
however, if resources do not permit both types to be implemented, the long
term trends illustrated by a line graph would be of more use than the 'snapshot'
histogram view.</font>
<h1>
<a NAME="IMPLEMENTATION"></a><b><font color="#3366FF">Implementation of
the Project</font></b></h1>

<p><br><font color="#FFFF80">The next design choices we faced were platform
and language. We decided to write our program in C++ linked with the GTK
1.2 windowing libraries on Linux because:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">MS Windows makes it hard to write modular applications</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">Linux has excellent TCP/IP support and standard networking
libraries</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">The GTK object model is easy to learn and use</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">C++ allows easy and transparent access to the GTK
object model</font></li>
</ul>
<font color="#FFFF80">Once we had decided to use TCP/IP to communicate
between modules, we realised that:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">This allowed the simulation to be calculated on one
machine and displayed over the network on another machine</font></li>

<li>
<font color="#FFFF80">The simulation engine was fairly portable - to run
it on another platform simply meant recompiling with the appropriate network
libraries</font></li>
</ul>

<h1>
<a NAME="CRITICISM"></a><b><font color="#3366FF">Criticism of the Project
Implementation</font></b></h1>

<p><br><font color="#FFFF80">The current implementation does not allow
the user to track or uniquely identify individual critters as they move
around the map. Moreover, one cannot select a critter and discover its
age, energy level or characteristics. Some of these values are represented
graphically, but not wholly intuitively.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">It could be argued that this is not a major problem,
since critters do not live for long, and the thrust of the project was
to create stable, long-term ecosystems. The characteristics of individual
critters are not important, since the statistics windows show both long
term trends and snapshot views of the system as a whole.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">However, if maps are large enough and varied,
a long simulation should show distinct species evolving in different areas
of terrain and altitude. It would not be possible to demonstrate clearly
the differences between groups of critters in different areas. Graphical
representations of the critters are useful, but not sufficiently clear,
especially to a new or impatient user who has not read the 'Critters' documentation.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">Overall, this feature is not essential and does
not detract from the project as it stands; it would merely be a nice feature
to have if the project were developed further.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">There is no command line scripting language. This
idea was discussed briefly at the planning stage of the project, and provision
was made in the network protocol for scripts, but time did not allow us
to implement it. As with the tracking of individual critters, this feature
would have enhanced the program a little, but would have required the user
to learn a new syntax and set of procedures and to have a good mental model
of the simulation engine. It would rarely have been used and is not a great
loss.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">When new critters are created, they are placed
on the map at random. Thus, a user cannot construct 'scenarios' for the
critters, but must just blindly hope. This is not ideal, and makes the
simulations fairly random and unscientific affairs. It could of course
be argued that it closely resembles real-life in this respect, since no-one
(with the possible exception of some supernatural being) has yet created
life from scratch and set it loose on virgin territory. Overall, the lack
of this feature detracts from the program.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">Creating new species of critters and editing the
characteristics of existing critters is poorly documented and text-based.
For a serious simulation tool, the difficulty of these tasks definitely
detracts from the functionality of the program. A graphical tool could
have been provided to allow easy loading and construction, but there was
not enough time to write this.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">The critters only have a certain number of behaviours
and characteristics, and move around in a small number of terrain types.
All of these variables were arbitrarily chosen and their effects pre-defined.
Thus, we are not really simulating evolution or breeding per se, but a
small, defined subset with a large but finite number of possible outcomes.
Additionally, the critters' behaviour, while it can evolve, is fixed for
the lifetime of a critter, though this is slightly mitigated by the fact
that critters with absurd behaviour patterns will die before they can have
too many offspring.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<h1>
<a NAME="CONCLU"></a><b><font color="#3366FF">Conclusions</font></b></h1>

<p><br><font color="#FFFF80">The original project brief was very basic,
and did not ask to us to recreate the universe in software. We successfully
defined and simulated an ecosystem, showing the effects of natural selection
in a small, defined and stable ecosystem. Failing to implement artificial
intelligence in the course of a four week first year undergraduate project
can probably be forgiven. While a number of interface features were not
fully implemented, these were not essential and do not detract seriously
from the project.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFF80">The project runs well, has a good range of critters
and produces stable ecosystems with minimal user intervention. It has a
fairly intuitive interface and it calculates and smoothly displays fast
simulations with large maps and many critters.</font>
