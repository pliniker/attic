Critters v1.0

Operating instructions:

To run a simple simulation:

run 'engine':
	command line options: (both or either may be ommitted)
		-m <map file> (defaults to test.map)
		-l <library file> (defaults to critters.lib)

The map file and library file should be created by the utility programs 'mapper' and 
'buildlib' respectively. Instructions on how to use these are included in their
 respective directories (utils/mapper/) and (engine/Library/)

then, run 'client': (either on the same machine or a seperate networked machine)
	command line options: 
		-h <hostname> (defaults to localhost (loopback))


buidllib
+------+

This is the tool for compiling many critter definition files into one usable
library file. It is very easy to used, simply type:-

./buidlib  :  to make a library called critters.lib from all
              the crittter definition files in the current
	      directory.
	      
./buidlib [filename] : to make a library called [filename] from
                       all the critters definition files in the 
		       current directory.
		  
The format of the critter definiton file is self explanatory and is best
learned by example, see carny.dat and herby.dat.

mapper 0.2
+-------------------+

command line options:

-fstdout : print output to console
-f<file> : print output to <file>
           note: don't enclose file in < >!

-mh# : sets map height to # squares
-mw# : sets map width to # squares

-t$# : set terrain type $ percentage to #
       if $ = 'w' then terrain type is water
       if $ = 'p' then terrain type is plains
       if $ = 'f' then terrain type is forest
       if $ = 'i' then terrain type is impassable

If you do not put the -f option first, the program will assume that it
is writing to standard out and will be silent. This may not be what you 
want, so specify a file or stdout as the first option.

+---------------------+
map file definition 0.1

x,y of map;x*y map squares with terrain type,altitude,initial food;

altitude defines temperature and hence speed of food growth and rate pf
critter energy use/loss.
water can be at any altitude, i.e. rivers and lakes are allowed.
altitude and food should be ignored if terrain type is impassable.

terrain type: 0 = plains
              1 = water
              2 = forest
              3 = impassable
              if outside this range, take it as 0 (plains).
altitude:     0 to 7; if outside this range, take it as 3.
food level:   0 to 255; if outside this range, take it as 0.
